## Project Title

Side Quest Week 5: Reflective Camera World

---

## Description

This project is a meditative, camera-led exploration experience set within a world larger than the screen. The environment scrolls continuously as the player moves, revealing hidden symbols and subtle visual details that only emerge when approached. The experience invites the user to drift through space using slow, responsive movement.

## Interaction Instructions

- Use WASD or arrow keys to move through the world
